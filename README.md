Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company that wanted to make sure they had a secure web page for their clients. They wanted their clients to be assured that their personal and financial information is secure when viewing online.
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
Coding securely is beneficial for many reasons. First, it protects the users and their personal and private information and data. Second, it helps the business in a couple ways. Customers wont want to use that business if they dont have security for the data given, especially a financial institution. It also helps prevent potential law suits from a breech in their system.
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
It was challenging and helpful to read through the dependancy reports and understand what and why they are on there.
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached increase layers of security with all the tools given to me. It is important to have as much security as you can, without disrupting the system too much. In the future, checking for current repositories of known issues and mitigations will be key.
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made sure they were functional and secure by running as many tests as I could and understanding the results.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Using dependancy reports was a tool I will use in the future.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I think the program using the encryption and check sum is a good example to use in the future for employers.
